The Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at
Northwestern University is pleased to announce the release of
NetLogo 5.0RC3, available for free download from our site at
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/ .

This is a release candidate for NetLogo 5.0. As such, there may be a
few bugs.  Please try it out and send us bug reports at
bugs@ccl.northwestern.edu and other suggestions and comments at
feedback@ccl.northwestern.edu. We really value your feedback and look
forward to hearing from you. Please let us know about bugs you find,
features you want, etc.

Most models created in earlier versions of NetLogo will work in
NetLogo 5.0RC3, perhaps with minor updates to the code. If you have
any trouble, please consult:
http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/5.0/docs/transition.html .

As befits the number 5.0, this release has major new features.  Among
those major features are: open source, internationalization, smart
plot widgets which eliminate the need for plotting code in the Code
tab, rich formatting features for the Info tab, transparency in 3D,
and support for functions as first class objects.  We invite and
welcome your comments on the features as well as reports on bugs that
you find.

We are excited by the opportunities resulting from the open sourcing
and internationalization of NetLogo.  We invite our users to help
localize NetLogo in their language, write extensions and publicize
them to the NetLogo community, contribute models to the NetLogo
community models page, and make improvements to NetLogo itself and the
NetLogo User Manual and send us the changes for integration.
