  // the Array implementation takes up vastly more memory than the LinkedList.
  // so with small message queues, we can support more clients using LinkedList.
  // its also very suspicious that we have such a high capacity. i think it
  // should probably be considerably lower, 500 or less. if 500 messages back up
  // and haven't been sent, thats a pretty good indication that something is
  // wrong with the connection. (Note, changing to to 1000 now)

  // very unlikely and maybe even impossible for them to fill this queue up.
