/**
Important Note:
LanguageTests (CommandTests and ReporterTests) now support testing stack traces directly.
Don't add any more tests here; add them there instead.

Here is an example from CommandTasks:

*command-task-stack-trace
   O> run task [print __boom] => STACKTRACE boom!\
   error while observer running __BOOM\
     called by (command task from: procedure __EVALUATOR)\
     called by procedure __EVALUATOR

notice the * at the start of the test name. this is to prevent it from
running in 'run' mode. in run mode, the stack trace is slightly different
since the top level procedure is run instead of __EVALUATOR.
its ok that these tests don't run in 'run' mode because we are only testing
the stack traces, not the results.
