# NetLogo

This page is for open source developers interested in the source code for NetLogo.

Other users should visit the NetLogo home page at [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).

## Contributions

We are excited by the opportunities resulting from the open sourcing and internationalization of NetLogo. We hope our users will take advantage of this opportunity to make improvements to NetLogo and the NetLogo User Manual that can be shared with the community.

Here are a few ways that your contribution would be most welcome:

 * bugfixes
 * new features
 * User Manual improvements
 * localization of NetLogo into more languages

We will develop a process for integration, based on GitHub pull requests, so that submissions can be reviewed for inclusion in the main NetLogo distribution.

We also hope users will continue to build and contribute extensions. Access to the source code should make it easier for developers to build new kinds of extensions.

## Developer documentation

Some docs are already available at https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki, including build instructions.  We will be expanding this soon.
