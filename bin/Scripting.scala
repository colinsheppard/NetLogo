// At one time, io.Source was flaky and sys.process wasn't in the standard library, so this class
// was important to have, because it replaced flaky io.Source and wrapped the low-level
// java.lang.Process/ProcessBuilder stuff and made it easy to use from Scala.  But Scala 2.9 has
// sys.process and an io.Source that seems reliable, so I reimplemented the methods here to just
// call those APIs.  What's left is just some thin wrappers that aren't strictly needed anymore.
// But I find them handy. - ST 9/14/11
